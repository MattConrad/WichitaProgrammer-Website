            <p>If you're looking for help with an .NET MVC project, you've come to the right place.</p>
            <p>
                You've picked a great framework. The .NET library is very solid, the ASP.NET MVC classes give you
                "enough" structure while still staying flexible, and Entity Framework is a respectable ORM (once you get used to it).
                Razor is a nice, easy on the eyes template engine. Tie in the server with jQuery on the front end 
                and you've got an excellent web development stack.
            </p>
            <p>
                (While Entity Framework is the default these days--and what I use most--I've also worked with
                ORMs like Subsonic, Fluent NHibernate, and <a href="http://www.toptensoftware.com/petapoco/">PetaPoco</a>.)

            <p>
                <strong>I'd like to hear more about your project.</strong>
                Send me an <strong><a href="mailto:matt@wichitaprogrammer.com">email</a></strong>, and 
                let's discuss what's needed to get your idea up and running.
