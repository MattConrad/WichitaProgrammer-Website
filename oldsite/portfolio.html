                    This project started because my wife didn't like any of the homeschool record keepers she found on the internet.
                    So I wrote one that she liked (super simple to use) and packaged it up for other people who share our taste
                    in record keeping. You can see the website

                    This was an entry page for a secure website written in ASP.NET. We wanted to be able to add new links to the page
                    without recompiling, we wanted to display a customized list of links based on the logged in user's name, and we 
                    didn't want to use a SQL Server database to store our data. The entry page uses XML files to define the links,
                    users, and permissions between those links and users.

                    This is a toy goal tracking project that I wrote to learn a little more about PHP and MySQL. The idea was to have 
                    a goal tracking application where every goal entered automatically included an explicit deadline.
                    I'm rethinking this idea and one of these days I'll throw out a new version running on Google App Engine.
