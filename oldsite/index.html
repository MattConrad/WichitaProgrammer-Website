            <p>Hello! You've reached WichitaProgrammer.com, which is me, Matt Conrad. I help businesses make their work flow more smoothly.</p>
            <p>A successful business has to stay on top of a lot of things at once. A well-designed website or data crunching application can <strong>save you a lot of labor, frustration, and money.</strong></p>
            <p>I enjoy sitting down with people and figuring out how we can make things <strong>more efficient and less frustrating</strong> at their company. Maybe I can help you, too. If you've got an idea, <a href="mailto:matt@wichitaprogrammer.com">drop me an email</a> and tell me about it.</p>

                        Matt was always a hit with our business people. He understood their needs and delivered quality solutions that
                        simply worked, no fuss, no muss.  As an IT manager I highly value the employee to whom I can give a task and
                        *know* that he or she will take it from there and hit the bullseye first shot. That's Matt.  He is versatile
                        in a variety of development tools and was always an engaged member of the team.

                        Matt Conrad has been an invaluable team member for us. He is extremely good at doing the tough jobs
                        and figuring out the odd problems associated with the development of a web based application.
                        Matt's networking abilities are a strong asset to the web development team as well. He is a very
                        punctual and reliable worker, and he does a good job of communicating with his peers and supervisors.

                        Matt is a skilled developer who was able to deliver excellent value to us. He was able to work with
                        very little direction and produced high quality code. I would definitely recommend Matt for .NET development
                        work and would look to hire him again in the future.

                        Matt has been my mentor since the beginning of my programming career, as well as a lifelong friend. His
                        integrity and technical expertise are exceptional and I seek his advice on a regular basis.

                        I always enjoyed working with you as you were able to effectively communicate both problems &amp;
                        solutions while at the same time being open to input from other stakeholders. There was never any
                        ego involved while working with you, as you were always concerned about getting the job done right
                        the first time &amp; in that sentiment we share the same commitment to our clients &amp; I
                        appreciated that immensely.
