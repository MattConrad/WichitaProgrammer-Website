                While most of my work these days is <a href="asp-net-mvc-developer-wichita.html">web development</a>,
                that's not the whole story. Sometimes you're looking for a .NET app that runs on the desktop.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's lots of little niches that are asking for a "traditional" desktop application.
                .NET Winforms is still a solid way to develop an internal app. 
                Or maybe you just need to accomplish one task reliably. A console app with a click-to-run
                shortcut on the desktop might look simple but save dozens of hours of labor a week.
                Need to communicate with other software? Add in WCF and Web Services.

                <strong>If you're looking for a bit of .NET help, I'd like to hear more about your project.</strong>
                Send me an <strong><a href="mailto:matt@wichitaprogrammer.com">email</a></strong>, and
