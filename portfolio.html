                This project started because my wife didn't like any of the homeschool record keepers she found on the internet. 
                So I wrote one that she liked (super simple to use) and packaged it up for other people who share our taste in 
                record keeping. You can see the website at 
                <a class="portfolio-link" href="http://www.homeschooldaybook.com">HomeschoolDayBook.com</a>.
                Anyone is welcome to download the trial version and test it out. Partial source code is available for this project.

                Here we had several agents that moved around a territory over the course of the day. We tracked their movements
                and displayed those movements as paths on a map, using the Mapbox API (operating similarly to Google Maps). Distinct regions
                within the territory are outlined. Each region displays data about itself when hovered over, and regions of particular 
                interest are highlighted in color.

                This client had complicated projects, each one involving many different parts. 
                Together we designed and built an application to manage these projects and all of their parts, giving them quick data entry and detail management.
                We also built project health measurements to show the progress of individual project parts and of different projects as a whole.

                A local service company was expanding and needed a better way to manage their work. We put together a system 
                tracking their jobs step-by-step, from the initial job call through to invoicing and payment. The new system also 
                improved tracking of employees and customers.

                Here I helped a financial services company with back office management. Notable improvements included a new electronic 
                signature process during loan applications, and integrating in real-time credit evaluation (using a 3rd party API) for new applicants.

                An engineering application had some bugs that needed cleaning up. Fortunately, it had a nice RESTful interface that lent itself well 
                to unit testing. I wrote the test suite that the lead programmer used to verify fixes and watch for regressions.

                Funhou.se was a website for virtual worlds users. Members could upload player cards from their favorite virtual 
                world and battle them against other users, set up a customized profile about themselves, and promote different 
                virtual world parties from a central location. I wrote the code and did the early design. (Later graphics and 
                layout changes were added by a designer.)

                Here we needed to provide limited web access to one of our call center databases. This application runs on a secure 
                website and automatically restricts data access to what is appropriate for the logged-in user. This application 
                allows viewing and modification of selected call center data, and also delivers summary reports of activities and 
                notable call center events using a Crystal Reports interface for ASP.NET.

                Python &emsp; Django &emsp; Google App Engine <br /> <br />
                This was a project that I did for fun when I was learning Django and was also interested in trying out the 
                Google App Engine platform. It's a concentration game with color names, printed in colors, where the name 
                and the printed color are out of sync with each other. Source code is available for this project.

                This application reviewed data from other organizations. The organization would supply us with an Excel 
                file containing the data to review, we'd import it into the database, and then our trained reviewers would 
                review each entry and mark it up with comments. The application included some tricks to allow very fast 
                completion of reviews, such as inserting predefined text snippets into text fields via mouse clicks.

                Cold Fusion &emsp; Javascript &emsp; Microsoft SQL Server <br /> <br />
                This project used Javascript to enhance a survey feature of a web application. The original version of the 
                survey displayed different types of questions (radio button group, yes/no question, text entry) in a vertical 
                form to be answered one at a time. After the enhancements, answers to one question could create ripple effects 
                through the rest of the survey. An answer to a question could cause other questions to be answered automatically, 
                hide questions from view, reveal questions that had previously been hidden, or combinations of these effects. This 
                feature also included an admin UI so the dynamic effects could be defined and managed by end users.

                A small proof of concept application, written to show the feasibility of allowing users to create their own forms 
                using the CK Editor rich text interface, and then collect and store data entered via those user created forms.

                A playable Sokoban game written in ASP.NET MVC that I wrote for learning and for fun. If you've never played Sokoban, 
                you should give it a try. Despite the simple gameplay, some of the levels are quite challenging. Source code is available

                This was an entry page for a secure website written in ASP.NET. We wanted to be able to add new links to the page without 
                recompiling, we wanted to display a customized list of links based on the logged in user's name, and we didn't want to use 
                a SQL Server database to store our data. The entry page uses XML files to define the links, users, and permissions between
                those links and users.

                Python <br /> <br />

                Python is my favorite language for playing around. Somewhere along the line I discovered www.pythonchallenge.com, a site 
                containing puzzles you can solve by writing little programs (typically using Python). I do these for fun--I'm currently 
                somwhere in the teens. Source code is available, if you don't mind spoilers . . .

                This was a redesign of an integrated accounting system. My rewrite simplified the accounting and billing cycle logic was 
                and the presentation of accounting info was restructured to allow much more information to be accessible at once while 
                still being easy to understand. After the rework, one user said work that used to take her 3-4 hours could be completed 
                in 20 minutes.

                This is a toy goal tracking project that I wrote to learn a little more about PHP and MySQL. The idea was to have a goal
                tracking application where every goal entered automatically included an explicit deadline. I'm rethinking this idea and 
                one of these days I'll throw out a new version running on Google App Engine. (Update: it turns out time tracking with 
                toggl.com works very well for me, so I won't be adding another goal tracker/todo list to the millions already out there.)

                This project was a WinForms front end to a database that collected mental health data from all of Kansas. The data set 
                was complicated, with several groups of data being collected and a viewable, editable history required for many of those 
                groups. This application allowed fast traversal of the data and additions or modifications to be made easily.

                We needed to present aggregate data for a large database. Aggregating on the fly was too slow, so we generated and cached 
                the summary data using a SQL Server job, and then made it available (allowing various permutations chosen by the user) on 
                the public website using this ASP.NET application.

                lengthy, but the cycle of submit and resubmit was very fast post-automation. The screenshot shows an example results file.

                This is a call center application originally written ten years ago. Normally I wouldn't include an application that old here, 
                much less one written in Visual Basic 6, but this one is a little special. It's still in use and has worked very reliably, 
                approximately 24 x 7, since the day it was launched. The core of the original design has held up through hundreds of new
