                Hello! You've reached WichitaProgrammer.com, which is me, Matt Conrad. I help businesses
                make their work flow more smoothly.
                <br /><br />
                A successful business has to stay on top of a lot of things at once. A well-designed
                website or data crunching application can save you a lot of labor, frustration, and
                money.
                <br /><br />
                I enjoy sitting down with people and figuring out how we can make things more efficient
                and less frustrating at their company. Maybe I can help you, too. If you've got an idea,
                drop me an email and tell me about it.
            </p>

                            Matt was always a hit with our business people. He understood their needs
                            and delivered quality solutions that simply worked: no fuss, no muss. As an
                            IT manager I highly value the employee to whom I can give a task and
                            *know* that he or she will take it from there and hit the
                            bullseye, first shot. That's Matt. He is versatile in a variety of
                            development tools and was always an engaged member of the team.

                            Proprietary Job Task Manager (TM) software tracks hundreds of Jobs in real time. This tool allows crews in the field to receive real time updates to jobs and work orders [...] giving an overall picture of where we stand for that day and where we need to focus in the days to come. The Task Manager system has become an invaluable tool that we use on a daily basis.

                            Matt Conrad has been an invaluable team member for us. He is extremely good at doing the tough jobs
                            and figuring out the odd problems associated with the development of a web based application.
                            Matt's networking abilities are a strong asset to the web development team as well. He is a very
                            punctual and reliable worker, and he does a good job of communicating with his peers and supervisors.

                            Matt is a skilled developer who was able to deliver excellent value to us. He was able to work with
                            very little direction and produced high quality code. I would definitely recommend Matt for .NET development
                            work and would look to hire him again in the future.

                            ego involved while working with you, as you were always concerned about getting the job done right
                            the first time &amp; in that sentiment we share the same commitment to our clients &amp; I
